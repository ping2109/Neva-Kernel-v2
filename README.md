Battery life focused. <br>LCD_DOZE variant added for AOSP users or AOD modders. <br>DT2W included. (might not work yet) <br>ZSWAP nuked. <br>Hotplug working. <br>2A Charging. <br>Android 10/11/12 supported. <br>Compatible with all versions of NevaOS, work best on Pure10 v4 and later. <br>I forgot the rest, you can find...

### Note:
Built from generic source (not ARES) with Linaro GCC 7.5.0 toolchain, since latest 10.2 has some issues with Android 11. <br>

### Even more note:
HWC "fix" is not actually a fix, just some mods to get around it, and now stop shit talking about me.

### EDIT: J7xelte available so far, more will come out later.
